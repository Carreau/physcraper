INSTALL


Currently requires python2.7.
Work is in progess on cleaning up the requirements, and making physcraper python3 ready.


Recommended install procedure is using a virtual env.

    virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.7 venv-physcraper

If that fails, you may have to use:

    python2.7  -m pip install virtualenv
    python2.7  -m virtualenv venv-physcraper

Once you have a venv-physcraper directory, you can run:

    source venv-physcraper/bin/activate
    ## This force reinstalling numpy first is key
    pip install --force-reinstall numpy==1.14.5
    pip install -r requiremenets.txt
    python setup.py install
