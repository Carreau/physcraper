INSTALL


Currently requires python2.7.
Work is in progess on cleaning up the requirements, and making physcraper python3 ready.


Recommended install procedure is using a virtual env.

    virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.7 venv-physcraper

If that fails, you may have to use:

    python2.7  -m pip install virtualenv
    python2.7  -m virtualenv venv-physcraper

Once you have a venv-physcraper directory, you can run:

    source venv-physcraper/bin/activate
    ## This force reinstalling numpy first is key
    pip install --force-reinstall numpy==1.14.5
    cd physcraper
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install

Dependencies:

    Currently complete phylogenetic updating requires
    raxmlHPC and muscle to be installed and in the path.

    Check if they are installed using 

    which muscle
    which raxmlHPC

    You can generate updated alignments to analyze using other phylogenetic software by creating a Scrape object and 
    running scrape.align__query_seqs()
